Plants vs Brainrots FAQ
Essential information for mastering Plants vs Brainrots gameplay and progression.

How do I start playing Plants vs Brainrots?
Begin by purchasing seeds from the in-game shop, plant them in your garden, and let them automatically defend against Brainrot waves. Collect defeated enemies and place them in your base to earn money for better seeds.

What is the most effective strategy for beginners?
Start with cheaper plants to create a frontline defense that slows enemies, while saving money for powerful plants in the back rows. This balanced approach maximizes both crowd control and damage output.

How does the plant fusion system work?
Use the fuse machine to combine multiple identical plants into stronger versions. For example, multiple charitos can be fused to create Mr. Carrot, significantly increasing offensive capabilities.

When should I consider rebirthing?
Rebirth only after meeting specific requirements, including owning rare plants like "the gazini" and "the trali." The +50% permanent boost to money and luck makes it worthwhile for long-term players.

Can I play without spending Robux?
Yes, Plants vs Brainrots is fully playable for free. However, premium purchases like the Carnivorous Godly Plant can significantly accelerate progression and provide powerful defensive options.

How do I distinguish this from other Brainrot games?
Plants vs Brainrots is specifically a tower defense game with wave-based combat, unlike Steal a Brainrot (collection tycoon) or Brainrot Evolution (pet simulator). Focus on the strategic planting and defense mechanics.





Plants vs Brainrots All Plants and Stats
Complete guide to all plants in Plants vs Brainrots, including stats, costs, mutation effects, and strategic gameplay tips

Plants Guide
Plants serve as your primary defense against brainrot invasions. Each plant has unique damage output and cost, with rarer plants offering substantially more power. All plants have a chance to grow with beneficial mutations that multiply their base damage.

How to Get Plants
Purchase seeds from George NPC next to your plot. Seed stock refreshes every 5 minutes. Plants take time to grow and attack brainrots in their specific lane. Each plant can spawn with different sizes and mutations that affect performance.

Mutation System
All plants can grow with beneficial mutations that affect their damage:

Normal – 1x base damage (standard)
Gold – 2x base damage
Diamond – 3x base damage
Neon – 4.5x base damage
Frozen – 4x base damage + freezes enemies for 0.3 seconds
All Plants List
Plant Name	Rarity	Seed Cost	Base Damage
Cactus	Rare	$200	10
Strawberry	Rare	$1.25k	25
Pumpkin	Epic	$5k	55
Sunflower	Epic	$25k	115
Dragon Fruit	Legendary	$100k	250

Carnivorous Plant	Godly	$25m	2200
Mr. Carrot	Secret	$50m	3500
Tomatrio	Secret	$125m	7600
Plant Strategy by Rarity
Rare: Start with Cactus ($200) - best early value
Epic: Pumpkin and Sunflower for mid-game core defense
Legendary: Eggplant offers double Dragon Fruit's damage
Mythic: Watermelon (750 damage) - gateway to elite tier
Godly: Carnivorous Plant (2,200 damage) for maximum defense
Secret: Mr. Carrot (3,500 damage) and Tomatrio (8,750 damage) - ultimate goals
Progression Strategy
Early Game (Under $10k)
Start with Cactus → Strawberry → save for Pumpkin. Prioritize mutated plants over higher normal tiers.

Mid Game ($10k - $500k)
Focus on Epic tier plants. Balance plant investment with brainrot income (70/30 ratio).

Late Game ($500k+)
Invest in Legendary+ plants. A Diamond Eggplant (1,500 damage) beats normal Watermelon (750).

End Game ($50M+)
Pursue Mr. Carrot and Tomatrio and focus on Neon/Diamond mutations on top-tier plants.

Key Tips
Mutation Priority
Neon > Diamond > Frozen > Gold > Normal. Frozen plants add 0.3s freeze effect. A Gold Cactus (20 damage, $200) beats Normal Strawberry (25 damage, $1.25k).

Defense Strategy
Place strongest plants at choke points
Upgrade one lane completely before spreading out
Maintain 70% brainrot income, 30% plant investment
Keep cheaper plants for emergency lane reinforcement




Plants vs Brainrots All Brainrots and Stats
Complete guide to all Brainrots in Plants vs Brainrots, including income stats, pity system, weight mechanics, and optimization strategies

Brainrots Guide
Brainrots function as both enemies and income generators. When your plants successfully defeat them, they join your collection and produce passive cash every second. Their income varies based on rarity and mutation, with size (weight) also affecting earnings.

🌱 Also see: Plants Guide - Learn about defensive plants and their damage stats

How Brainrots Work
Brainrots attack your garden in waves through lanes. Successfully defeated brainrots join your inventory and generate passive income continuously (even offline at reduced rates). Heavier brainrots produce more income - all values shown are for 10.0kg average weight. Sell unwanted brainrots to Barry NPC for instant cash.

Guaranteed Drop System
Legendary Guarantee: Every 100 spawns guarantees a Legendary brainrot
Mythic Guarantee: Every 500 spawns guarantees a Mythic brainrot
Rebirth System: Increases luck permanently but removes all current brainrots

Normal – 1x base income

Neon – 4.5x base income
Frozen – 4x base income

10.0kg: $600/s (base income)
20.0kg: ~$1,200/s (double income)
Strategy: Keep larger versions, sell smaller duplicates. Large + mutated brainrots are the ultimate prize.

Income Strategy by Rarity
Rare: Fluri Flura ($6/s) - decent starter income
Epic: Lava Jato ($30/s) - mid-game core, needs Pumpkin+ plants
Legendary: Madung ($45/s) - excellent ROI, sweet spot tier
Mythic: Bombardiro/Bombini ($180/s) - major income boost
Godly: Matteo ($600/s) - income king, needs Mythic+ plants
Secret: Garamararam ($2,100/s) - ultimate goal, game-changing income
Progression Strategy
Early Game (Under $1k/s)
Target Epic tier with Pumpkin-level defense. Prioritize mutations: Gold Epic > Normal Legendary.

Mid Game ($1k-10k/s)
Use 100-spawn pity for Legendary. Invest in Legendary plants for Mythic capture.

Late Game ($10k+/s)
Hunt Mythics with 500-spawn pity. Build Mythic+ defense for Godly capture.

Endgame ($50k+/s)
Pursue Secret brainrots with perfect mutations and maximum weight.

Key Tips
Collection Management
Keep larger, mutated brainrots; sell smaller duplicates
Use pity system timing for major defense upgrades
Consider rebirth only when significantly stuck
Maintain income growth for continuous plant upgrades
